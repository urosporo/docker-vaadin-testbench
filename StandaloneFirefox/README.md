## What is Vaadin Testbench?
_Vaadin Testbench is based on Selenium and automates browsers to test Vaadin-based applications._ That's it! What you do with that power is entirely up to you. Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!) also be automated as well.

Selenium (Vaadin Testbench) has the support of some of the largest browser vendors who have taken (or are taking) steps to make Selenium a native part of their browser. It is also the core technology in countless other browser automation tools, APIs and frameworks.

See the Vaadin Testbench [site](https://vaadin.com/docs/v8/testbench/testbench-overview.html) for documation on usage within your test code.
